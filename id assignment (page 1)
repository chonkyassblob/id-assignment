        <p3>This was my first ever job. I worked as a waiter in a restaurant
            <br>
            named Supply and Demand for 2 months. I was tasked with wiping
            <br> 
            and clearing of the tables, delivering food and taking orders 
            <br>
            from customers. From this job, i got to learn how to interact better
            <br>
            with strangers. However it was really tiring as we had to 
            <br>
            stand for very long hours with very few and short breaks. 
            <br>
            All in all, it was a very fun and good experience.

        <div class="content-small2"><h2>Job 2</h2>
        <p4>For this job, i worked as a warehouse packer. It was a very physical job 
            <br>
            as i was required to carry heavy boxes and pack and store many things
            <br>
            throughout the day with only one break for lunch. This job was really physically 
            <br>
            demanding and really tiring in my opinion. However it was still a good experience
            <br>
            as i tried something i never did before.</p4>
