            <p1>I have a huge interest in sports and the English language. Whenever possible, i would go out to play
                my favorite sports with my friends. This is a good form of catching up and exercise to help me keep fit
                and healthy.As for my interest in English, my father is an English teacher and i have been reading books 
                ever since i was young. This helped me develop love for the language and ever since then i have always been
                interested and intrigued by the language.  </p1></div>

            <div class="content-small"><h2>STRENGTHS</h2>
            <p2>I would say i am a very sociable person with good communication skills which enables me to interact well with people
                even if they are strangers. I also learn and pick up things really quickly which allows me to adapt faster in a new 
                environment. I think that these strengths of mine are really essential in the workforce and would be very benefitial to 
                companies if they were to hire me. These are what i have to offer.
